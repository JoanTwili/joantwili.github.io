# Joan Twili- Persnal portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal website [joantwili.github.io] (https://joantwili.github.io/).
This site showcases my projects, learning journey and interests; from Control Systems to Machine Learning. Also a fun way to see how my art could potentially be woven into some of my projects.

## Purpose
I'm aiming to present my projects in a way that gives more insight into:
- What each project does
- Why it matters to me
- The tools and data used as well as the skills gained 

## Current stack
- HTML/ CSS/ JS
- Github Pages

## Future Plans
- Build on web design and interactivity
- Work on web aesthetics
- Connect notebooks directly
